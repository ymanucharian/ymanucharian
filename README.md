### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Yosyf and I have 6 years of experience in Quality Assurance. But now I want to learn and have some practice in Automated testing because in the upcoming future I want to speed up performing regression, smoke testing or repeated tests. Automated testing it's a new experience for me. I hope that I'll enjoy every completed task and will be able to use the gained experience in my daily work.
